What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	1. A repository is initialized.
	2. Because the repository won't be initialized.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The working directory is the folder containing the files you may wish to work on. The repository is the place where you will want to put those files after you have finished the work. So the value of the staging area is that it provides a temporary area, to stage the files you have worked on, before you commit them to the repository; this give you the ability of commiting only particular files instead of all the files in the working directory.
